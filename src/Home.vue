        subtitle="Diminished Value Loss is the reduction in your vehicle's market value after it's been in an accident,
      even if fully repaired. Buyers often see a car with a history of damage as less desirable,
      leading to a lower resale or trade-in value compared to a similar car without any accident history.
      This loss reflects the stigma and perceived risks associated with a previously damaged vehicle, making it crucial
      to understand when filing an insurance claim."
